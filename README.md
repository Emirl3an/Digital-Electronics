Digital Electronics

Difficult: For Beginners

What is Digital Electronics? Digital electronics is defined as: Digital electronics is the branch of electronics that deals with the study of digital signals, and the components that use or create them.

Digital electronics, digital circuits, and digital technology are electronics that are operated on digital signals. Digital techniques are much easier for getting the electronic device. These devices are used to switch into one of the known states apart from reproducing a continuous range of values. Digital circuits are made from a large collection of logic gates and a simple electronic representation of the Boolean logic function.
